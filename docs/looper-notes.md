# Live looper: research notes

Goal: 4 stereo tracks recorded live from the audio input, with mute / clear / fader per track, run from a Looper mode
on the Mixer screen (MIX cycles Mixer -> Mute -> Solo -> Looper).

## Found so far (stock 3.1.9)

- **SDRAM allocator** (64 MB at 0xC0000000, allocated top-down from 0xC4000000):
  - `FUN_08044404` alloc(bytes) -> pointer. 16-byte header, 16-byte aligned, 56 callers. On failure it prints
    "ERROR: No more extended memory: crash" and halts: never call it without checking free space first.
  - `FUN_08044470` free(ptr), 102 callers.
  - `FUN_080443f0` free bytes = `*0x24000088` (top) - `*0x2400008c` (floor). The boot log prints it as
    "Initialized. Internal = %dKB, External = %dKB" (`0x08043e12`).
- The type name "looper" (id 0x16) in the preset type table (`0x08094xxx`) is a shared-framework name next to
  laser-controller types; no looper code behind it was found.
- Recorder settings exist as params (`recinput`, `recmonmode`, `recquant`, ...): the recorder's input path is the
  place to look for the audio-input tap.

## Next

1. Hardware: the 3.1.n build on this branch shows free SDRAM after the CPU load on the version label
   ("3.1.n 12/20% 41M"). That figure sets the track length: 4 stereo 16-bit tracks cost 768 KB per second.
2. Find the audio-input buffer in the audio task (`FUN_08041470`) / recorder path.
3. Looper engine (record / overdub / play / mute / clear / level, first track sets the length) + Unicorn tests.
4. Looper mode on the Mixer screen, following `src/solo.c`.
