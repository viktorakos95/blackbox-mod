/*
 * Sequencer: a note added or moved just ahead of the playhead plays on this pass. Original 1010music Blackbox, 3.1.9.
 *
 * Stock: a pattern keeps its notes sorted by start in a list whose [2] is the play index (the next note to play; the
 * player plays notes while start + loop start < now and advances it). A sorted insert (FUN_08063938) bumps the index
 * when the new note lands at or before it, so a note dropped right ahead of the playhead lands exactly at the index
 * and is counted as already played; so is one added after the last note. It sounds only on the next pass.
 *
 * This wraps the note-seq object's edit methods (vtable 0x080d0744: +0x58 add / update, +0x5c delete). After the
 * stock edit, if the edited pattern is the one playing, the index is recomputed from where the playhead really is:
 * index = number of notes with start < now - loop start; the note just placed also plays if it landed at most
 * GRACE ticks behind the playhead with nothing in between. Notes ahead of the playhead play on time this pass; notes
 * behind it, or already under it, wait for the next pass; nothing is skipped or played twice.
 * "now" is recorded per sequence by wrapping the call to the player (it is computed exactly as the player does, so
 * it is there even while the pattern is empty). Time-stretched sequences (+0x5e) are left stock.
